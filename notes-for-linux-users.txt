PREREQUSITES
============

Perl. Probably already functional on your system. To test, in any
console window, issue:

    $ perl -v (or maybe --version)

GET
===

You can get the code via git or a zip file

Git
---
Git may already be functional on your system. It isn't on my CentOS distro
but I don't care as I develop on Windows.

If you want to make changes to the scripts and contribute them to the
GitHub repository (encouraged), I suggest you use Microsoft's Visual
Studio Code (VSC) to install git. It's kind of like swatting flies with
a hammer but VSC is an excellent editor and you can configure it to
single-step through the code. Git is built in. Works for a bunch of
other stuff too.

Find a place on your computer where you would like to have a directory
called FlCovidPerlScripts. Open a console window there.

Issue the command:

   $ git clone https://github.com/MickeyLane/FlCovidPerlScripts.git

ZIP
---

Go to Github.com
Search for FlCovidPerlScripts
Go to the page and see a green button labeled Download. Choose zip

USE
===

1) Open a console window in FlCovidPerlScripts.

Edit global_definitions.pm using whatever. It's a small file.
Read the comments and change as needed.

IMPORTANT: Pay particular attion to $record_debug_limit_value at the
bottom of the file. AS CONFIGURED, THE MAKE_NEW_FILES.PL SCRIPT WILL
ONLY PROCESS 5 LINES FROM EACH FILE.

2) Open a console window in the directory that contains all of your
case line data files. It's assumed there is one subdirectory for each date.

Issue the command:

   $ ls -d 2020* > dirs.txt

Hopefully, dirs.txt will look like:

   2020-03-16
   2020-03-17
   2020-03-18
   2020-03-19
   etc.

If it doesn't, we need to discuss and fix something before proceeding.

3) Go back to FlCovidPerlScripts

Issue the command:

   $ perl make_header.pl

When running a perl script for the first time, you may get a message like:

  Can't locate File/chdir.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
  File::chdir module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5
  /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl
  /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5)
  at make_header.pl line 16.

This means that (in this case), the perl module File::chdir
is missing from your perl installation.

Issue the command:

   $ yum (stuff goes here)
   
Use Google to find out how to update your perl using yum.

On my vanilla CentOS system, I had to install

   DateTime
   File::chdir

If make_header.pl works, you should see a long output ending with:

   Unified column names:
   00 Gender
   01 Case1
   02 ChartDate
   03 DayofM
   04 Contact
   [...]
   19 EDvisit
   20 Case_
   21 CaseDate
   22 ObjectId
   23 Travel
   24 State

Issue the following:

   $ perl make_new_file.pl
   $ perl normalize_data.pl

You are done. Examine new files in each date directory
