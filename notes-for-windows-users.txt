Notes for Windows users

WHAT IS THIS?
=============

These scripts (3 .pl executables and 3 .pm modules) will read any number of
case line data .csv files and produce 2 new .csv files for each date with a
unified set of column names.

Note that this code NEVER modifies any of the source files it acts on.
It creates two new files for each date and you may change what they are named.

PREREQUSITES
============

Perl. Suggest Strawberry Perl. Install using defaults.

GET
===

You can get the code via git or a zip file

Git
---
If you want to make changes to the scripts and contribute them to the
GitHub repository (encouraged), I suggest you use Microsoft's Visual
Studio Code (VSC) to install git. It's kind of like swatting flies with
a hammer but:

Two reasons:

   1. Git is a linux thing and the Microsoft implementation of it works
      well on Windows.
   2. VSC is an excellent editor and you can configure it to single-step
      through the code. Git is built in. Works for a bunch of other stuff
      too.

Find a place on your computer where you would like to have a directory
called FlCovidPerlScripts. Open a console window there.

Issue the command:

   $ git clone https://github.com/MickeyLane/FlCovidPerlScripts.git

Zip
---

Go to Github.com
Search for FlCovidPerlScripts
Go to the page and see a green button labeled Download. Choose zip

USE
===

1) Open a console window in FlCovidPerlScripts.

2) Edit global_definitions.pm using whatever. It's a small file.
   Read the comments and change as needed.

   IMPORTANT: Pay particular attion to $record_debug_limit_value at the
   bottom of the file. AS CONFIGURED, THE MAKE_NEW_FILES.PL SCRIPT WILL
   ONLY PROCESS 5 LINES FROM EACH FILE.

3) Open a console window in the directory that contains all of your
   case line data files. It's assumed there is one subdirectory for each date.

   Issue the command:

      $ ls -d 2020* > dirs.txt

   Hopefully, dirs.txt will look like:

      2020-03-16
      2020-03-17
      2020-03-18
      2020-03-19
      etc.

   If it doesn't, we need to discuss and fix something before proceeding.

   4) Go back to FlCovidPerlScripts

   Issue the command:

      $ perl make_header.pl

Possible perl error
-------------------
When running a perl script for the first time, you may get a message like:

  Can't locate File/chdir.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
  File::chdir module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5
  /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl
  /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5)
  at make_header.pl line 16.

This means that (in this case), the perl module File::chdir
is missing from your perl installation.

Issue the command:

   $ cpanm File::chdir

The cpanm tool will go find the missing script and install it
This is part of perl. It will not affect anything else on your system.

On my vanilla CentOS system, I had to install

   DateTime
   File::chdir

I do a lot of perl work so my Windows system has dozens of packages
installed and I have no idea what a new install of Strawberry will need.

If make_header.pl works, you should see a long output ending with:

   Unified column names:
   00 Gender
   01 Case1
   02 ChartDate
   03 DayofM
   04 Contact
   [...]
   19 EDvisit
   20 Case_
   21 CaseDate
   22 ObjectId
   23 Travel
   24 State

   Issue the following:

      $ perl make_new_file.pl
      $ perl normalize_data.pl

You are done. Examine new files in each date directory
