When running a perl script for the first time, you may get a message like:

  Can't locate File/chdir.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
  File::chdir module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5
  /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl
  /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5)
  at make_header.pl line 16.

This means that (in this case), the perl module File::chdir
is missing from your perl installation.

For Windows:

   cpanm File::chdir

For Linux:

   yum <whatever goes here for your system>

The cpanm tool will go find the missing script and install it
This is part of perl. It will not affect anything else on your system.

On my vanilla CentOS system, I had to install

   DateTime
   File::chdir
